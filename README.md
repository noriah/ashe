A library for accessing the riot api based *loosely* around lol-js

Tests will be written soon

## Features
- All Ashe functions return promises. Isn't that nice
- Limit-By-Region - Riot limits api calls by region, so Ashe does too
 - If one region gets limited, the others keep going
- Caching - Ashe is ready to cache your data, making multiple calls lightning fast
- All calls to the api are separated by region, and each region has its own 'thread'
- Ashe will retry up to five times if an error occurs

### Current API Versions

## Usage

### Basic Usage

// call your methods
var champions = client.getChampions('na')
```

### With a Redis Cache
