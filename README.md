A library for accessing the riot api based loosely around lol-js

Tests will be written soon

Documentation: <http://amreuland.github.io/ashe/docs/index.html>

## Features
- All Ashe functions return promises. Isn't that nice
- Limit-By-Region - Riot limits api calls by region, so Ashe does too
- Caching - Ashe is ready to cache your data, making multiple calls lightning fast
- All calls to the api are separated by region, and each region has its own 'thread'
- Ashe will retry up to five times if an error occurs

```bash
npm install ashe
